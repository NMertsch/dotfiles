# example usecase: default uses HDMI output, which has no speakers
# use 'pavucontrol' to determine wanted behaviour (gets reset on inactivity)
# determine name and profile from 'pacmd list-cards'
# test it with 'pactl set-card-profile <symbolic-name> <profilename>'

# example: 'pactl set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_00_03.0 off'

# this does not prevent the profile to be reactivated e.g. when headphones are unplugged
